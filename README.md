### Hi there üëã

‚ÄúIn the end, when it's over, all that matters is what you've done.‚Äù - Alexander the Great üå±

### Who am I? 

My name is Yohanan Negash üá™üáπ and I am a junior in [George Mason Univeristy](https://www.gmu.edu/) majoring in computer science. I enjoy working on myself and learn about the world as much as I can. The best word to describe me is ambitious, but I have come to understsand the true meaning of how actions speak louder than words. Therefore, I will refrain from talking about myself and let my actions do the talking.  

### What I am upto right now? 

I am trying to create more than I consume. I am currently interested in business, to be specific eccomerce. Most of my time is spent on trying to learn more about ecommerce and business and figuring out how I can incorporate my Computer Science knowledge into it. 

### What am I using Github For?

I don‚Äôt use Github primarily for coding as much as I used to. Instead, I find it valuable as a platform for tracking my work and organizing my projects in various ways. It's important to note that Github can serve other purposes beyond just code managment and version control. For me, it has become a versatile tool for managing and diversifying my workflow. 

That being said, if you‚Äôre interested in collaborating on a project or simply want to have a conversation about anything, please feel to reach out to me on Discord : `Yoni#8746`. I‚Äôm open to discussing potential collaborations or talk about anything honestly.
